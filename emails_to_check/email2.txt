Hello Jim,

We wanted to let you know that we have made some changes to the schedule for our upcoming company event. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to move the date to two weeks later than originally planned. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

The event will still feature exciting guest speakers and interactive workshops, and we hope that you will be able to attend. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

In addition, we would like to remind you of our company policy regarding personal use of company resources. Please refrain from using company equipment or network for any personal purposes, as it can put our company's security at risk. We have recently noticed an increased number of incidents related to this policy, and we want to emphasize its importance.

As always, thank you for your hard work and dedication to our company.

Best regards,

The HR Department
